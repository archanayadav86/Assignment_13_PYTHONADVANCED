In a very large list or say in a program where input() of users gets appended to the list, it'd be hard or impossible to know the last item or the last one in. In such a case, indexing the list at -1 should grab you the last item in your large list or the last one input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, note that you can use negative indexing to fetch the same item you do with positive indexing. The index absolute values MIGHT just be off but not necessarily so.

    "Ans-->Python is a very flexible language where a single task can be performed in a number of ways, for example initializing lists can be performed in many ways. However, there are subtle differences in these seemingly similar methods. Python which is popular for its simplicity and readability is equally infamous for being slow compared to C++ or Java. The ‘for’ loop is especially known to be slow whereas methods like map() and filter() are known to be faster because they are written in C. Knowing the better and faster way to initialize lists might give you a slight edge in competitive programming.\n",
